# Test-Of-Time
Test of Time - Text based strategy game

NOTE: This is an old project, from over 10 years ago when I had first started learning to code. While the code is not at all representative of my current abilities or standards,
I have included the pinned ones on my profile because it is fun and functions, and holds a somewhat special place in my heart, as the first program I ever wrote.
